Activity 2
# Base Class: Vehicle
class Vehicle:
    def move(self):
        pass  # This will be overridden by subclasses

# Derived Class: Car
class Car(Vehicle):
    def move(self):

# Derived Class: Plane
class Plane(Vehicle):

# Create instances of both classes and call the move method
car = Car()

car.move()  # Output: Driving 🚗
plane.move()  # Output: Flying ✈️
